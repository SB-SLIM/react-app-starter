# Roadmap

Living plan for evolving this repo into a production-grade multi-tenant SaaS starter.

---

## Goal

Build an **open-source, multi-tenant SaaS starter** that can be forked to ship vertical SaaS products (travel agency, e-commerce, car marketplace, …).

- Every tenant ("workspace") has **collaborators** (internal team, role-based) and **clients** (the workspace's end-customers).
- Launch capacity: ~100 users. Architecture must scale to **1M–2M users** without rewrites — only adding replicas / shards / read pools.
- **~90% open source.** Paid infra (VPS, CDN) and a handful of hosted services are acceptable. No proprietary lock-in inside application code.
- **Stateless application tier** behind a load balancer.
- **Multi-tenant from day one** — every domain model is tenant-scoped.
- **Batteries-included plugins** — `@sb-codex/*` cover the full platform layer so a new product starts with auth, UI, typed API, background jobs, and infra already wired up.

### Plugin boundary (applies to every `packages/*`)

Every plugin is **product-agnostic** — reusable in any project, with no business logic or domain schema.

| Plugin                    | Ships                                                             | Does NOT ship                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@sb-codex/core`          | Pure utils (format, slugify, type guards, …)                      | Product-specific helpers                                |
| `@sb-codex/ui-components` | Design system — primitives, layouts, patterns                     | Brand colors, product copy                              |
| `@sb-codex/config`        | `createEnv()` Zod loader                                          | App-specific env vars                                   |
| `@sb-codex/db`            | Platform schema (auth + tenant) + RLS + `createDb()`              | Business/domain tables (`client` = example template)    |
| `@sb-codex/auth`          | Auth server config + client facade (email + Google)               | Custom auth flows                                       |
| `@sb-codex/api-contracts` | tRPC factory (`workspaceProcedure`, middlewares) + `healthRouter` | Project `AppRouter` — assembled in the consuming server |
| `@sb-codex/jobs`          | BullMQ queue definitions + typed payloads                         | Domain-specific job processors                          |

**`AppRouter` lives in the project, not the plugin.** The server assembles its own `appRouter` from the platform `healthRouter` plus project-specific routers. The admin imports `AppRouter` as `import type` from the server (monorepo: relative path; deployed: a project-owned type package).

## Locked architecture decisions

| Layer                    | Choice                                                                                                                              |

## Releases

Versioned delivery milestones. The phases above roll up into these releases. The first vertical product built on the starter is a **travel app**, whose lifecycle drives the deployment-target shift.

| Release                                       | Scope                                                                                                                                                        | Deploy target                 | Status     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| **v0.x — Starter beta**                       | Phases 1–9: multi-tenant RLS core, auth UI, theme system, CI/CD, prod deploy, `@sb-codex/*` plugins on npm (`beta`) + `create-sb-app` scaffolder             | VPS (`hub.slimbouchoucha.tn`) | ✅ Shipped |
| **v1.0 — Production starter + Travel app v1** | Phases 10–13: testing (Vitest + Playwright), client management UI, member management, billing. First vertical (travel app) built on the starter and launched | VPS                           | ⏳ Next    |
| **v2.0 — Cloud-native**                       | Migrate off the single VPS to **Google Cloud or AWS**: managed Postgres / cache / object storage, IaC (Terraform), k8s optional. Travel app v2 runs here     | GCP / AWS                     | 🔭 Planned |

The VPS compose stack is the baseline **through v1**. Cloud manifests and IaC are intentionally deferred to the **v2.0 — Cloud-native** release — see the Scope guard.

## What's shipped

### Auth flow

- Signup → auto-create workspace → store slug in `localStorage` → dashboard
- Login → fetch existing workspaces → restore slug → dashboard
- Auth guard on `/dashboard` — redirects to `/sign-in` if no session
- Nav shows email + logout when authenticated

### Multi-tenant isolation

- Every `workspaceProcedure` call opens a transaction with `SET LOCAL app.workspace_id`
- RLS policies (`USING` + `WITH CHECK`, `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`) enforce isolation at the DB level — no manual `WHERE workspace_id = ?` needed
- The **server** connects as the non-privileged `app` role (RLS applies); **migrations** connect as the superuser (bypass, intended). Pointing the server at the superuser silently disables isolation.
- `x-workspace-slug` header resolved by tenant plugin → workspace looked up + membership verified
- Regression test `packages/db/src/__tests__/rls.test.ts` (CI job `rls-isolation`) proves a tenant cannot read/write another's rows

> **ADR-001 (2026-06-06):** isolation stays **shared Postgres + RLS** (not schema-per-tenant — that caps tenant count and complicates migrations). Per-tenant backup/export/delete is a separate lifecycle concern, to be solved on top of RLS. Mirrored on Notion.

### Publishable plugins

- The 7 `@sb-codex/*` packages are published to npm under the `beta` dist-tag (`0.0.1-beta.x`).
- `@sb-codex/create-sb-app` (tag `latest`) scaffolds a new project: `pnpm create @sb-codex/sb-app@latest <name>`.
- The scaffold is **apps-only** — `apps/` only, `@sb-codex/*` pulled from npm at the published version with peer deps injected; `packages/`, `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/` and changeset config are stripped.
- `@sb-codex/auth` bundles `better-auth` as a regular dependency (facade engine), not a peer.

### CI/CD pipeline

```text
push → main
  └── CI (lint/typecheck/test — Node 20+22)
        └── if success → Build & Push Images (native arm64 runner → GHCR)
                  └── if success → Deploy to VPS
                        ├── git pull
                        ├── docker compose pull   ← images from GHCR (no downtime)
                        ├── docker compose up -d  ← 2-5s downtime per service
                        └── migrate
```

- Build concurrency: `cancel-in-progress: true` — new push cancels old build
- Deploy concurrency: `cancel-in-progress: false` — deploys queue, never interrupted mid-flight
- Gate job: Build workflow fails (not skips) when CI didn't pass, preventing Deploy trigger

### Production stack (hub.slimbouchoucha.tn)

- Traefik v3.1 with file provider + Let's Encrypt `tlsChallenge`
- `PathPrefix(/api)` → Fastify, catch-all → nginx/admin SPA
- All services on internal Docker network — only Traefik exposes ports 80/443

---

## Scope guard

This roadmap does **not** include:

- Building a specific vertical (travel, e-commerce, cars) — those are forks
- Cloud deployment manifests (k8s, Terraform) — VPS compose stack is the baseline **through v1**; cloud + IaC arrive in the **v2.0 — Cloud-native** release (GCP/AWS)
- Mobile clients — tRPC router types are reusable for React Native later
